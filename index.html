<p><strong>KQ9 : How far was Stalin to blame for starting and spreading the Cold War?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cold War: term given to the conflict that existed between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) after World War II (1945-1989). The two sides did not come into direct contact, (ie there was no &lsquo;hot&rsquo; war), but attacked each other with propaganda, non-cooperation and economic measures</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beginnings of the Cold War : 1945-1949</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Spring 1945, British, American, and Russian troops entered Germany on all sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They celebrated the victory over nazism, however only three years later. the alliance had broken up angrily .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical issues :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain, France and USA helped those fighting communism in Russia, 1919-1921</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Allies held a series of military expeditions with the objective to interfere with the Russian civil war .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals of resisting the Bolshevik revolutions and helping the Czechoslovak Legion, which supported the Allies .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Czechoslovak Legion held the Trans-Siberian Railway and several notable Siberian cities .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allied forces landed in cities like Vladivostok as part of the North Russia intervention</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allied efforts hampered by divided objectives and war-weariness from overall global conflict, the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion in September 1920, compelled Allies to end intervention in 1921 .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nazi-Soviet Pact 1939&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or known as the Molotov&ndash;Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that enabled the two powers to partition Poland between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump Started the Nazi invasion of Poland, and the start of World War 2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allied powers recognised Stalin&rsquo;s power grab and desire for self gain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t trust Russia, as they will said with the side that&rsquo;s most successful&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katyn Massacre&nbsp; April-May 1940&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of mass executions of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and intellectual academics by the USSR, mainly by the NKVD .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovered in 1943, the USSR denied allegations and involvement until 1990</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strained Allied and Soviet relations, Allies saw the communists as animals, who cannot be trusted&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of time western allies took to open second front :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin longed pressured the Western Allies to open a second front</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">28 million russian soldiers died, 37 million civilians</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin pressured in Tehran Conference 1943</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally significant push in D-Day 7th June 1944</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defeat of Nazism, leads to a power vacuum in Central Europe .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communism vs Capitalism ideological differences :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American and Soviet ideologies opposed each other completely and each side was convinced that the world needed to adopt their ideology .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USA supported self-determination and open market liberal capitalism .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USSR supported proletariat (workers) rising up and destroying capitalism and world problems, and creating a worker&rsquo;s paradise</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yalta Conference : 4-11 February 1945</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as the Crimea conference and codenamed Argonaut, World War II meeting of Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill to discuss the postwar reorganization of Germany and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aimed to create a post war peace that gave self determination to the liberate people of post Nazi Europe .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreement to prioritize the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. After the war, Germany and Berlin would be split into four occupied zones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreed to operate a 5 D&rsquo;s policies : demilitarization, denazification, democratization, decentralization, and deindustrialization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany would have to pay reparations financially and also through German resources and labour</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin pledged to permit free elections in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin agreed to enter the fight against the Empire of Japan "in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potsdam Conference : July 17 - August 2 1945</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting of Joseph Stalin, Clement Attlee, and Harry Truman to decide how to administer Germany, and also included the establishment of the postwar order, peace treaty issues, and countering the effects of the war:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soviet troops now occupy Eastern Europe and no Soviet-demilitarisation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland is now communist controlled - no free elections</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New members Truman and Attlee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atomic bomb - Truman told Stalin of US&rsquo; new weapon, bigger enemy threat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagreements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They disagreed over what to do about Germany.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They disagreed over Soviet policy in eastern Europe. Truman was unhappy of Russian intentions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin wanted to cripple Germany, Truman did not want to repeat the mistakes of Versailles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They disagreed over reparations. Once again Stalin wanted to cripple Germany, and Truman wanted to avoid another war.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman was angry because Stalin had arrested non-communist leaders in Poland.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman dropped the atomic bomb so that Japan would surrender before Russian troops could go into Japan. America had the bomb in July 1945, but Truman did not tell Stalin about it. When he saw how he had been tricked, Stalin was furious.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors increasing tensions :</span></p>
<p><strong>Russia control Easter Europe, no free elections in countries like Poland</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction of Truman, more anti-communist, hard liner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power Vacuum from absence of Germany and revelation of atomic bomb By Harry Truman</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four occupation zones of Germany plan conceived at the Yalta Conference were set up and administered&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin, Vienna, and Austria were also each divided into four occupation zones</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Allied power was to seize reparations from its own occupation zones, although the Soviet Union was permitted 10&ndash;15 percent of the industrial equipment in the western zones of Germany in exchange for agricultural and other natural products from its zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poland moved westward, with its new borders being the Oder and Neisse river&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagreed on how much reparations to take from Germany - Soviet policy in Europe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin wanted to destroy Germany&rsquo;s economy so they will never rise again</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman wanted to keep Germany healthy to avoid another war and to contribute to world trade</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagreed on Allied interference in Eastern Europe - Stalin wanted communist control of Eastern Europe, Allies obviously opposed to that - wants to set up free elections</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria already communist controlled at this point</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;By 1946, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, and Albania all communist</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviet take-over and control of Eastern Europe :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did the USSR want control of Eastern Europe ?</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They felt they had the right to decide the future of postwar Europe . Soviet Union pretty much single-handedly won the war in Europe. 28 million military casualties, 37 million civilian casualties, 85% of German losses sustained on Eastern Front.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believed communism was a superior form of government, and they wanted to help spread it - helping along Marx&rsquo;s communist prediction . Ww2 proved communism success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin wanted to control EE to protect the USSR from a future attack . 65 million people died in WW2( 28m in military and 37m in civilians), Stalin wanted the USSR to never be attacked again . Eastern Europe to serve as a buffer zone against future aggression</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin wanted to control EE because that was the easiest way to ensure the countries were pro-soviet, and didn't support capitalism . EE countries anti-soviet before WW2, and they might be anti-soviet again if they became independent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin did not trust the USA not to use capitalism to control and influence the EE . Convinced american businesses are planning to spread their power to increase profits . Communist influence will stop growth of American capitalism</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 1945-1948 the USSR extended its control over all the countries of Eastern Europe . Soviet leadership set up anti-fascist coalition governments, with communists operating leading roles . These govts nationalized industries and took control of private land . Opposition parties slowly undermined, elections were rigged and eventually communists took control .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Iron curtain?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchill described the border between east and west as the Iron Curtain .</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Why did the grand alliance break down after WW2 ?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grand alliance was already weak from the start. This because the Soviets had signed a Nazi-Soviet non-agreesion pact&nbsp; back before WW2. This already weak alliance, further broken down as the 2 sides started to question each other.Stalin thought that the Western Allies purposely delayed the Invasion of Normandy so they could conserve troops and resources or let soviet union take all the damage from Nazi Germany. On the other hand, Churchill was scared since the Soviets neither helped the Poles in the Warsaw uprising nor declared war on the Japanese until the last second. So he was eager to take as much of Europe as possible, since he didn&rsquo;t want Europe to fall into the hands of another dictator, Stalin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warsaw uprising:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1st August - 2 October 1944</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polish resistance tried to free the Warsaw ghetto/ They could've done it with the help of the USSR, but the USSR refused to. This made the Western allies question the aims and goals of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchill&rsquo;s Iron Curtain speech : 1946</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe... all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence, but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A speech delivered by Winston Churchill in March 5 1946</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in which he stressed the necessity for Western Powers to act as the guardians of peace and stability against the menace of Soviet communism, which had lowered an &ldquo;iron curtain&rdquo; across Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchill acknowledges the Iron Curtain, the political, military, and ideological barrier between the USSR and the Eastern Bloc, and the Western democratic countries</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Telegram : July 1947</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Telegram, known as the &ldquo;X Article&rdquo;, published as an article in July 1947, containing over 5,000 words</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written by George Kennan, a diplomat at Moscow at the time, advocating for America&rsquo;s use of containment against the hostile USSR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stated that the Soviet basis of ideals were hostile and evil, and the US could not hope to make peace with it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called to readily protect the Western world from any Russian and communist geopolitical expansion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called for countering &ldquo;Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known as a leading Soviet expert, his statement guided US foreign policy to containment pof communism.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salami Tactics : First used in Hungary after WW2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist Parties uses a gradual process of threats and alliances to overcome opposition</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then take over key groups like the police</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then party able to dominate the political landscape - slice by slice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, seize power by infiltrating the non-communist political landscape and take control from within</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very successful, Russia quickly controls many Eastern European countries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, In 1946 the Hungarian Workers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;party had only 17% of the vote</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2 years, every single political party in Hungary except the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democrats had completely disappeared or been rendered powerless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Czechoslovakia 1968 : Prague Spring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salami tactics did not work in Czechoslovakia and a violent takeover (coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat) was used by the communists to forcibly take over .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late February 1968, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, with Soviet backing, assumed full control of the country</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist "Action Committees" and trade union militias were quickly set up, armed, prepared to carry through a purge of anti-Communists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klement Gottwald threatened of a general strike unless a communist-dominated government was formed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy of containment : The policy with the acceptance of communist control over existing governments, but with the aim to stop any further communist ideal expansions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman thinks that Communism is not the future, therefore it must be stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S were involved in events such as the CMC and Korean War because of this policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman Doctrine : 1947-1948</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announced to congress by President Harry S Truman on March 12 1947 and further developed on July 4 1948</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Truman Doctrine is an American foreign policy with the primary goal of containing Soviet geopolitical expansion during the Cold War, constructed during the Truman presidential era .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman directly voiced his willing hostile opposition to Communism and therefore Russia - could be considered a silent declaration of war .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eg Used when Turkey was pressured by the Soviet government to allow Russian shipping to flow freely through the Turkish Straits, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage. Turkey received $100 million in economic and military aid</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marshall Plan : April 3rd 1948 - 1951</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marshall plan was passed by congress in 1948.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S transferred 13 billion USD in economic recovery programmes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, improve European prosperity, and prevent the spread of communism</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USSR didn&rsquo;t allow Eastern European countries to accept the aid: showed weakness of communism if accepted and a way to lure away allies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accepted by 16 countries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin introduced Cominform in response.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Berlin Blockade:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background : At the end of WWII after the Yalta Conference, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union divided the defeated Germany into four occupation zones . Berlin, located within the Soviet-occupied zone, was divided as well, with the Western part of the city in Allied hands and the east under Soviet control .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Led by Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union wanted to punish Germany economically, forcing the country to pay war reparations and contribute its industrial technology to help postwar Soviet recovery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Allies saw Germany&rsquo;s economic recovery as crucial to preserving it as a democratic buffer against the spread of communism from Eastern Europe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the western powers wanting to solidify capitalist presence in Berlin, As a result, the United States and Britain agreed to combine their occupied zones to create Bizonia on the 1st January 1947, and combined with France to form Trizonia in 1st August 1948&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ultimate goal of forming West Berlin into a unified western state, the western powers introduced a new currency, called Deutsche Mark into West Berlin without informing the Sovet Union</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviets immediately issued their own currency, the Ostmark, into Berlin and eastern Germany.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 24th June 1948, the Soviet Union blocked all road, railway and canal access to the Allied-occupied zones of Berlin, announcing that the four-way administration of the city had come to an end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin Blockaded it since West Germany was:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful capitalism showcase&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A military base for the western powers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A place for Easterners to defect . Over 1.5m Eastern Germans have crossed into West Berlin by 1950</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A place military pressure on the West to concede plans and influence&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allies unified Western Germany in a meeting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviets withdrew from the Allied Control Council as soon as they knew of this plan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the Allies react:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their blockade, the Soviets cut some 2.5 million civilians in the three western sectors of Berlin off from access to electricity, as well as food, coal and other crucial supplies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Allies made a plan to deliver 3500 tons of supplies daily. Peak daily delivery was 13,000 tons .&nbsp; At its peak, there was a plane carrying supplies every 30 secs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. and British planes carried out the largest air relief operation in history, transporting some 2.3 million tons of supplies into West Berlin on more than 270,000 flights over 11 months</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin didn&rsquo;t stop the blockade because he hoped the Western powers would give up in trying to create a West German state</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally ended when the USSR lifted the blockade on 12th may 1949 .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequence:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Germany remained divided for over 40 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NATO and Warsaw Pact introduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symbol of the hardened rivalry between the East and the West</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost the US around 200-500$ million dollars</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comecon : Known as The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established in January 1949 to facilitate and coordinate the economic development of the eastern European countries belonging to the Soviet bloc.By controlling the governments to do and produce what the USSR was asking for, the USSR benefited from it. However, countries in the Eastern bloc suffered since they didn&rsquo;t get any of the stuff they produced, weakening their economy even more. This led to many uprisings</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cominform : Known as The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Established in October 1947, Its aim was to tighten Soviet control in Eastern Europe, to build collective nationalised industry in those countries and to create a trade network between Communist countries. It was again used by the USSR to order what the Eastern countries had to do. It was a response to America&rsquo;s Marshall plan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was created as a military alliance between Western Countries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries like the US, Canada, and Britain signed it, to provide collective security against the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1955, West Germany became a member of NATO&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this perceived threat, the Soviet government organised the Warsaw Pact (1955) with her seven European satellites in order to organise defence of Eastern Bloc</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warsaw pact was created on 14th May 1955 as a reaction towards NATO. It was a treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland between the USSR and 7 other Eastern Bloc countries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces and their respective ideologies into the respective territories .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Soviets claimed that the organization was a defensive alliance, it soon became clear that the primary purpose of the pact was to reinforce communist dominance in Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see this in the introduction to the treaty : &ldquo;Western Germany, which is being remilitarized, and her inclusion in the North Atlantic bloc, which increases the danger of a new war and creates a threat to the national security of peace-loving states.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KQ 10:&nbsp; How effective was the USA&rsquo;s policy of containment ?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 1949, The Soviet Union publicly announced that they now have the nuclear missile which surprised the US who developed it just 4 years ago in 1945. Thus the nuclear arms race began .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Korean War : </strong><strong>25 June 1950 - 27July 1953&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction: The Cold War had been going on as the US tried to stop the spread of Communism by Containment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1947, Korea divided along the 38th parallel</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korea controlled by USA</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea controlled by USSR</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Why didn't the USSR veto the invasion of North Korea by UN forces?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The western influenced UN refused to acknowledge the newly formed chinese communist government and thus the USSR was protesting against the decision to not admit china into the UN. Consequently, the USSR didn&rsquo;t use its VETO power albeit it was a permanent member.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korea was split up after WW2, with a Communist North and Capitalist South.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim Il Sung was the leader of North Korea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syngman Rhee was the leader of South Korea. Although he was a bad leader, he was capitalist, and had spent 35 years in America.The South Korean army was generalled by Douglas Mac Arthur.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 25 1950, Kim Il Sung's </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist army crossed the 38th Parallel and invaded non-Communist South Korea trying to unify Korea under Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s rule</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kim Il-sung's North Korean army, armed with Soviet tanks, quickly overran South Korea, the UN and the United States came to South Korea's aid. North Korea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;had 90,000 troops with medical and military assistance from USSR most notably Mig 15 fighter jets, tanks&nbsp; and military advisors&nbsp; ( BUT NO RUSSIAN TROOPS DIRECTLY INVOLVED)&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Korea received 40,000 troops (US + UN) and had 100,000 so altogether had 140,000 troops. (Note these were at the start of the war and both sides numbers increased later as more civilians got involved)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle of Pusan Perimeter : August 4 1950 &ndash; September 18 1950 (1 month)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle of the Pusan Perimeter was a large-scale battle between </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations Command</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (UN) and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forces</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It was one of the first major engagements of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korean War</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An army of 140,000 UN + SK troops, having been pushed to the brink of defeat, were rallied to make a final stand against the invading </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korean People's Army</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (KPA), 98,000 men strong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><strong>he massive North Korean assaults were unsuccessful</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in forcing the UN troops back further from the perimeter, despite two major pushes in August and September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Incheon landing : 15 Sep 1950 &ndash; 19 Sep 1950 (4 days)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle of Inchon was an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amphibious invasion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a battle of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korean War</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that resulted in a decisive victory in favor of the United Nations Command (UN). The operation involved some 75,000 troops and 269 naval vessels and led to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Seoul"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recapture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the South Korean capital of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seoul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two weeks later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The code name for the operation was Operation Chromite.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Battle of Inchon happened because the South Korean and UN troops were fighting desperately at Pusan, so they needed others to relieve pressure.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 25th June 1950 Kim&rsquo;s armies, supported by Soviet equipment and advisors, crossed the border.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 days later on the 28th of June, North Korean forces had entered the South Korean Capital Seoul.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incheon Landing: However, since the NK army's supply lines were over-stretched, US general MacArthur decided to land </span><strong>269</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ships</span><strong> 250km</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind the enemy line.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pyongyang fell on the 19th of October 1950.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the UN troops pushed too far back into North Korea</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China then joined the war on 26 November 1950 re-capturing Pyongyang on the 6th of December, and Seoul on the 4th of January 1951</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America re-captures Seoul on the 14th of March 1951</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time a stalemate developed at the 38th parallel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 1951, General McArthur was removed from position</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truman was replaced with Eisenhower in 1952</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stalin died in 1953, and an armistice was signed on July 1953</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loses during the Korean War:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost 54,000 men, 100,000 wounded</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost 415,000 men</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NK lost 1 million men</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 38th parallel continued dividing a Communist North Korea from a Democratic South Korea</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes of the Korean War</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US was therefore quite successful in containing Communism :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It held Communist advances to the 38th parallel, which remains in place today</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US did well considering it had few options - Syngman Rhee was a corrupt and ruthless anti-communist politician, but was the US best option</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It showed the support the UN had for the US</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only around 500,000 troops supporting the South died compared to about 1 million supporting the North</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cuban Missile Crisis : 16 October - 20 November 1962</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The historical relationship between Cuba and the USA was of a colonial relationship, where the ownership of Cuba&rsquo;s economy was by Americans, and political ideals in the country were capitalist-influenced, with many investors and companies establishing in Cuba, it served as a US ally and for US military bases (Guantanamo Bay) and serves as a holiday destination for the American people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Cuban lower income people were unhappy at their unfair government</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Fidel Castro overthrow the Government:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because before the revolution in 1953, Batista was the Leader of Cuba. Batista </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">caused a lot of unrest within and out of cities. Within the cities (Havana, Santiago, ec), workers were suppressed by Batista's rule and were subject to poor working conditions and poor living conditions. The wealth gap between classes was substantial and the poor were uneducated and didn&rsquo;t have basic living necessities. Batista didn&rsquo;t get elected. He overthrew the government and became the dictator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing certain electoral defeat, Fulgencio Batista led a military coup that made him win the election in 1952, suspending the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the rights to strike, and banned the Cuban Communist Party as he was a capitalist backed by the united states</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1959, Fidel Castro and his group of insurgent overthrows Batista (the US backed dictator), entered the capital on 8 January 1959 and established a Communist govt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castro took over US land and businesses</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He regarded US presence in Guantanamo Bay as illegal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 250,000 wealthy Cubans left</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castro (Fidel)&nbsp; did not keep with his promise of holding free elections, claiming that national unity has been created</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1960, a Soviet-Cuban alliance was created, with a trade agreement worth over $100 million signed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Reactions to the Cuban Revolution :</span></p>
<p><strong>In Jan 1961, the US broke of diplomatic relations with Cuba</strong></p>
<p><strong>And between 1960 and 1964 the U.S. imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all Cuban-owned assets in the U.S&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 1960, President Eisehower approved a CIA plan to overthrow Castro . Over 400 CIA officers were employed full time in Operation Mongoose .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Mongoose was a series of terror attacks and covert operations plans to overthrow Castro</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And approved to train and send Cuban exiles back to Cuba to overthrow Castro</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In it were over 20 attempts to kill Castro, such as giving him chemically altered cigars, and sneaking thallium salts into his shoes so his beard falls out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USA Committed</span><strong> over $100 million to overthrowing Castro</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as the CIA tried to sabotage his communist regime</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Bay of Pigs : 14th April 1961&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CIA controlled invasion plan under the Kennedy administration, where Cuban exiles(1400 cuban exiles) were trained to invade Cuba and spur the Cuban people to rise up and overthrow Castro but it was quite the opposite as the invasion would make Castro very popular in Cuba and people would side with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 14th, US planes bombed Cuban airfields (Leaving Cuba with eight planes and seven pilots after)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 17th, just 1400 CIA trained Cuban exiles arrived at the Bay of Pigs on five ships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were met by 20,000 Cuban soldiers, armed with Soviet tanks and modern weapons</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total US failure : 2 ships were sunk, including one carrying the majority of the supplies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 planes giving air cover were shot down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And within 72 hours (3 days), all invading troops were killed, wounded, or had surrendered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consequences : Another humiliation USA had already been humiliated many times</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikita Khrushchev ridiculed the US&rsquo;s pathetic attempt to get rid of communism in Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It made Kennedy look weak and ineffective</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennedy later admitted the Bay of Pigs made communism and Fidel Castro even more popular in Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castro and Khrushchev became closer allies and became even more suspicious of the United </span><strong>States</strong></p>
<p><strong>The USSR has developed Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles which can carry nuclear bombs at least 5,000 km in 1957, while the USA developed ICBM in 1959</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From May 1962, the USSR publicly began to deliver missiles to Cuba as part of Operation Anadyr to prevent an invasion of Cuba by US forces</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennedy was confident the USSR would not dare to put nuclear missiles in Cuba, and warned the Soviet Union he will stop the placing of nuclear weapons in Cuba &ldquo;By whatever means might be necessary&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USSR assured America that would not send nuclear missiles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 1962, 150 Soviet ships transported disguised nuclear missiles to Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By September 1962, Cuba:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">cuba was the best-equipped nation in whole of South America</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of non nuclear missiles and bases</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrol boats, tanks, fighter planes, and bombers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radar stations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5000 stationed Soviet technicians to train Cubans</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USSR did this to :</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To scare America and to retaliate against the threat of US jupiter missiles placed in Turkey . In Khrushchev&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;putting one of our hedgehogs down the Americans' trousers"</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khrushchev wanted to shorten the missile gap, and make his short and medium range missiles effective - with most of missiles being equipped to target the majority of far away American cities, such as New York and Los Angeles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test Kennedy - Khrushchev wanted to see what the new young president would do</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use as a bargaining chip with the US and reduce US arms race advantage- Khrushchev would use the missiles on Cuba as tool, only removing them if America agrees to his demands</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To genuinely defend Cuba from an invasion</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Cuban Missile Crisis /October Crisis : 16th October - 20th November 1962</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 14th Oct 1962, a US U-2 spy plane took reconnaissance pictures of missile sites on Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To intelligence experts,&nbsp; it was obvious that these sites :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were intended for nuclear missiles, were being built by the USSR, and could be made quickly ready in 1 week, with some missiles already been readied</span></p>
<p><strong>US spy planes also identified 20 soviet ships bound for Cuba, carrying 42 medium range weapons with 164 warheads, and 42,000 troops to protect them</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why were the US concerned about this :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missile based in Cuba could strike US key areas - most of continental US now fell under the range of medium range missiles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USA could not allow itself to be intimidated by the USSR - Conceding to the USSR will humiliate America</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It strengthened the threat of Communist expansion- which the US is now committed to defending against.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many in the US demanded a strong response : Many military officials and Cuban exiles wanted Kennedy to make a response needed to expose Khrushchev&rsquo;s vulnerability - America has been challenged by Khrushchev over Berlin and the Bay of Pigs already and Kennedy needed a victory</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close relationship with Cuba - US interest in Cuba since 1823 and they wanted to maintain that</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennedy&rsquo;s Option in Retaliation :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 1 : Do nothing and allow the USSR&nbsp; to build up missile sites in Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adv : The Americans still have a Cold War military advantage, and don't need to risk a global conflict . The USSR wouldn&rsquo;t dare to use the missiles against the US - no need to overreact and cause a danger to peace</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dis Adv: The USSR lied about the Cuban missiles, and obviously had a plan building up . Kennedy already issued warnings, and to not carry them out would show weakness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 2 : An immediate air attack to surprise and destroy the nuclear bases&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adv : It would destroy all missiles and therefore danger to the US</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dis Adv : Destruction of all sites could not be guaranteed . The attack would kill Soviet soldiers and the USSR might retaliate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To attack without warning was immoral like Pearl Harbour</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 3 : An all out invasion of Cuba by land and sea&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adv : A successful invasion would get rid of the missiles and Castro . The american forces were trained and available to succeed&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dis Adv : It would mean a Soviet immediate retaliation, either to protect Cuba, or the destruction of US controlled spheres of influence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 4 : Get the UN to condemn and pressure the USSR to negotiations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adv : It would avoid conflict if successful and paint the USSR as the obvious enemy against an international organization</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dis Adv : It makes the US seem weak, relying on others to help stop the conflict</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Option 5 : A blockade on Cuba, banning further military shipments, and threatening checks of Soviet ships and orders to leave Cuban waters</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adv : It would show US seriousness and strength, but not a direct act of war . Pressure on Khrushchev to make the next move, and the US had a strong navy to do so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dis Adv : It would not solve the problem of missile presence in Cuba,which could be quickly made ready . The USSR could retaliate back on Berlin, etc</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What were the key moments in the Crisis?</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the 14th October, a U-2 Spy Plane discovere</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">d the ballistic missile sites</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 16th October, the CIA informed Kennedy of the definite presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba and a white house meeting was called</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 20th October,</span><strong> a conclusion was reached to blockade Cuba, stopping and searching all ships heading to Cuba</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 22nd October, </span><strong>Kennedy publicly announced Soviet missiles in Cuba, and the ongoing blockade, and ordered USSR to take back the missiles&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cuba announced a combat alarm as both sides prepare for war</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US announced it will use every force to search all ships heading to Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 25th October, aerial photography showed continuous development of missile sites</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 26th October, Kennedy receives a letter offering to negotiate over missiles in Cuba with the removal of blockade and guarantee of no US invasion of Cuba</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 27th October, Kennedy receives second letter calling for withdrawal of US missiles in Turkey</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the same day, a US U2 plane shot down over Cuba &amp; pilot killed. Kennedy decided to ignore second letter, but accept terms of 1st letter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US entered DEFCON 2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">26th October, Castro informed all weapons ready</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 27th October, Kennedy sent an ultimatum :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That If the USSR did not promise to remove its missiles from Cuba the next day, the US would destroy them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would be no official, public agreement, but if the USSR removed the missiles, the USA would secretly remove their missiles from Turkey and Italy. The USA would also promise never to invade Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 28th October, Russia finally accepted&nbsp; Kennedy&rsquo;s promise of&nbsp; not invading Cuba, and that the USSR will withdraw their weapons from Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear missiles were dismantled and removed under UN supervision. The Soviet ships left Cuba in early November 1962.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What were the consequences of the Crisis?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western nuclear missiles were withdrawn from Turkey, and USSR missiles from Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidel Castro was irate from not hearing about this decision first hand, and Cuba-US tensions worsened - Cuba remained communist and heavily armed, dependent on the USSR for supplies and weapons</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khrushchev was publicly portrayed by the military as weak (backed down to USA), succumbing to the pressure of Kennedy, which contributed to his dismissal in 1964</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and losing the trade</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Khrushchev was able to claim a triumph: Cuba remained an ally &lsquo;in Uncle Sam&rsquo;s backyard&rsquo;, and he was able to claim that he was the responsible peacemaker</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennedy had avoided another defeat. The deal to remove warheads from Turkey was not made public until 1968</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helped speed up improved thawing &ndash; the world saw the danger of MAD, and both sides were prepared to take steps to avoid another conflict. A permanent &lsquo;hotline&rsquo; telephone link between the </span><strong>White House &amp; Kremlin was set up.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1963 a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>KQ11: &ldquo;Why did the USSR lose control over Eastern Europe ?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction :&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviet Union controlled Eastern European national governments by appointing communist leaders at government positions. rigging elections, and salami tactics, propaganda, comicon and comintern, cominform, etc</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth in these countries slowed, unemployment rose and people witness the successes of non-communist states</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the euphoria and hope of&nbsp; USSR ideologies had worn off, there was realization of a dictatorship in Eastern Europe .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People in Eastern Europe also continued experiencing rations, and consumer goods were very scarce . This did not endear them to communism and they wanted to break free from the &ldquo;prison&rdquo; they were held in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is De-Stalinization?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-Stalinization consisted of a series of political reforms in the Soviet Union after the death of long-time leader Joseph Stalin in 1953, and the ascension of Nikita Khrushchev to power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-Stalinization : In Mar 1953, Stalin died and Korean war had ended on 27 July 1953. He had been an unstopp`able force in the USSR and his words had been law. Despite committing many crimes, he was revered as almost a God because he was guiding the nation and there had to be a leader.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>What was Nikita Kruschev&rsquo;s opinion?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikita Khrushchev felt that Stalin had been too forceful and that communism needed a softer approach . At the 1956 Communist Party Conference. Khrushchev denounced Stalin as a violent tyrant and began a program of De-Stalinization . e.g. freeing political prisoners, etc .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led to the start of soviet collapse as loyalty to the USSR by fear of Stalin began to erase</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khrushchev&rsquo;s actions encouraged those in Eastern Europe who wanted reform to push for change, and Krushchev was himself humiliating STalin&nbsp; eg: by destroying Stalin Statues -&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Berlin Wall was built by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) during the Cold War to prevent its population from escaping Soviet-controlled East Berlin to West Berlin, which was controlled by the major Western Allies. (France, USA and Britain)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wall was called by the USSR as the &ldquo;Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart&rdquo;, publicly shown as to defend the Eastern Bloc from the villaneous capitalists</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West Berlin government referred to it as the &ldquo;Wall of Shame&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Berlin wall was first built in 1961 and was later reinforced so people could not escape anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did the Soviet Union build the Berlin Wall ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From WW2 to 1961 over 4.5 million people fled to West Berlin from the East.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And these included</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;useful people like engineers, teachers, doctors etc and most importantly people who were needed in East Berlin factories- so a wall was built on 13 August 1961.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because West Berlin was a successful showpiece of capitalism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This demotivated East Berliners and showed how weak Communism was.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protests had already happened in Poland and Hungary in 1956, showing the anger of citizens</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disproportionality of construction between East and West clearly showed the aim of the wall of keeping east germans in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 1962, a second, parallel fence, also known as a &ldquo;hinterland&rdquo; wall (inner wall), was built some 100 metres into East German territories</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These death walls were lined with smooth pipes on top, mesh and signal fencing, anti-vehicle trenches, barbed wire, guard dogs, "beds of nails" called Stalin&rsquo;s carpet, with death strips between the walls with raked sand, guard soldiers, and no covers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers lined with instruments like Czech hedgehogs and guarded by watchtowers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 1961 and 1989, the Wall prevented almost all such emigration, and during this period, over 100,000 people attempted to escape, and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall, with about 200 casualties .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krushchev later said in a speech that Berlin was the testicles of the West and would make the West scream. Berlin is the testicle of the West. When I want the West to scream, I squeeze on Berlin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Prague Spring of Czechoslovakia : 5 January &ndash; 21 August 1968 (8 months)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the communist coup d'&eacute;tat in 1968, Czechoslovakia was a tightly controlled state with a stagnating economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist leader </span><strong>Novotny began to lose his grip on </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">power. The reason for this was the excessive imprisoning and killing of innocents who protested against the communist regime, and his hardline rule</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novotny&rsquo;s reforms called the (&ldquo;New Economic Model&rdquo;) failed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USSR forced Czechoslovakia to produce raw materials, most of which were taken to the USSR, and they did not allow for production of consumer goods which was deemed Selfish and arrogant by many and similar to the French attitude during the Treaty of Versailles - squeezing like a sponge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Czechoslovakia had to follow the first (49-53) and second five year plan (56-60), which forced them to follow Russia&rsquo;s desire for an increase in producer goods&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">production</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1966, Czech students began protesting for greater political freedom and less Soviet control</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Jan 1968, the hardliner communist, Novotny was forced to resign, and was </span><strong>replaced by Alexander Dubcek</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the leader of the Czech Communist Party</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubcek wanted to implement and reform communism in Czechoslovakia, &lsquo;socialism with a human face&rsquo; and allowed a free media and freedom to criticize the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubcek wanted :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater political reforms and decline in censorship</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten year programme for political change, leading to democratic elections and a multi-party state&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduction in the powers of the secret police, including no more imprisonment without trial&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removal of travel restrictions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage trade with Western Germany</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase in worker&rsquo;s rights</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warsaw Pact leaders feared these reforms would spread and threaten their control&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 1968, Warsaw Pact countries, led by the USSR, invaded Czechoslovakia to avoid this reform process from spreading. The new Brezhnev Doctrine said no Warsaw Pact member could leave&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brezhnev feared Czechoslovakia withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It was centrally placed and would divide the alliance&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He feared NATO would move in&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He feared that similar ideas would spread to other eastern European Soviet satellites (as did Communist leaders of these states) Domino effect (but spread of capitalism not communism)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brezhnev already saw the effects of the loosening control on the level of criticism - Reformist writer&rsquo;s Vaculik&rsquo; manifesto &ldquo;The Two Thousand Words&rdquo; was signed publicly by many Czech intellectuals and artists</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So on the 21st August 1968, 2000 Soviet tanks rolled in with orders from Brezhnev killing approx. 100 people.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around half a million Warsaw Pact troops also entered Czechoslovakia&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However the Czechs learnt from the mistakes of the people in the Hungarian uprising, so the Czech army refused to fight back</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prague Spring was seen as example of civilian-based defense, with civilian resistance fighting Soviet control for over 8 months, while the USSR expected it would only take 4 days to subdue the country</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance was everything from sabotaging street signs, defying curfews, to protesting by self-immolation and suicide - such as Jan Palach setting himself on fire at Wenceslas Square in Jan 1969</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 300,000 people emigrated out of Czechoslovakia&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubcek and other reformers were arrested and taken to Moscow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviet Union tried to put Czechoslovakia to pre-1968 using&nbsp; reforms with hardliners such as Gustav Husak put back into place as the First Secretary of the Czech Communist Party in 1969 .&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reformers just wanted freedom, but the Soviet Union yet again used force, with resistance from civilians obviously showing the unhappiness of the Czech people to hard line communism . This made other communist officials and countries question the USSR and showed how weak and unstable the Soviet control over Eastern bloc really was</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romanian President Ceausescu refused to send military support to Czechoslovakia as he supported Dubcek&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mao Zedong saw the Brezhnev doctrine as the ideological basis for a Soviet invasion of China, and launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia - Chinese premier Zhou Enlai supported the Czech people waging guerilla war against the USSR</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brezhnev Doctrine : First outlined in Sept 1968 , one month after the Prague Spring Invasion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brezhnev doctrine was a Soviet foreign policy that proclaimed any threat to socialist rule in any state of the Soviet bloc was a threat to them all, and would result in the intervention of fellow socialist states.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It was proclaimed by Leonid Brezhnev in order to justify the Soviet-led occupation of Czechoslovakia earlier in 1968, and also past Soviet aggression, such as the invasion of Hungary in 1956</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was to make sure liberalization efforts were destroyed and Communist Parties remained loyal to the Kremlin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brezhnev publicly shows that the USSR was completely unwilling to lose any control over eastern European states. This foreign policy lasted 20 years, since no one dared to question it since both the Czech and Hungarian uprising failed, showing Soviet power.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy showed clearly how the USSR operated in fear and oppression, and the lack of social criticism freedom made Eastern Europeans resent communism even more</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy was finally abandoned by Gorbachev, who wanted more freedom amongst the satellite&nbsp; Communist states</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hungarian uprising:23 </strong><strong>Oct 1956 &ndash; 11 Nov 1956</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hungarian uprising was the </span><strong>first test to Soviet power </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">over Eastern Europe. Already, between the years 1945 and 1956, Eastern European countries were forced to labour under Cominform to produce for the USSR, which was detrimental to the lives of the Hungarians.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Hungary was also under a hardliner leader Matyas Rakosi</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who enforced many rules restricting the Hungarian citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AVH or the Secret Police imprisoned anyone who went against Communist rule</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a single year, more than 26,000 people were forcibly relocated from Budapest in a plan by the Rakosi government to obtain housing for Communist Party leaders, and to remove the threat of the intellectual class</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hungary agreed to pay war reparations approximating US$300 million to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia and to support Soviet garrison, which&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounted for around 20% of their annual income</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1949 the leader of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Cardinal Mindszenty, was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for treason</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hungarian citizens were especially angry at the restrictions of freedom of speech, and the presence of Soviet soldiers and officials, which they have to pay for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hungarian economy was at a standstill, and rations of bread, flour, sugar and meats were taking place</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lead-ups to the revolution:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">23rd October, 1956: Over 20,000 students protested in Budapest&nbsp; They pulled down the statue of Stalin, chanting a censored patriotic song &ldquo;The National Song&rdquo; and cut the communist symbol of Hungarian flags</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That night, communist leader Erno Gero asked for Soviet intervention and assistance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;25 October: Soviet tanks fire on protesters, killing 12, and wounding 100</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">26 Oct: Imre Nagy was reinstated as Prime Minister</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hungarian resistance fought Soviet tanks with molotov cocktails, burned communist flags, books and propaganda, and infiltrated Communist Party buildings and executed party members</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After around five days of street fighting, Soviet troops withdraw to the countryside</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So under the new reform leader of Imre Nagy, the following reforms were declared on the 1st of nov:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom from Soviet interference, and the dissolution of the Secret Police</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Elections</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of Speech</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom to Worship</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Free&rdquo; Goulash</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that Hungary would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact (and Soviets are like tf bitch im coming)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4th Nov &ndash; Although Khrushchev wasn&rsquo;t as harsh as Stalin and wanted to reform the Eastern bloc by allowing a bit of freedom, he had decided Nagy had gone too far.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the second Soviet intervention, called Operation Whirlwind, he ordered Soviet Tanks to enter the city once again 3 days after the reforms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000 Hungarians were killed, Nagy was executed, 200,000 citizens fled to Austria.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did they fight back?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because they had already overthrown the government, so there was no turning back</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They just wanted reforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&rsquo;t expect Soviet tanks to come, killing them, angering them even more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They thought US would help them, but the U.S was too busy with the Suez Crisis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khrushchev already allowed some reforms to take place since he removed the tanks</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity: Poland 1980</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is solidarity?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidarity was a movement started in 1980 by Lech Walesa.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first Eastern Europe non-communist controlled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade union c</span><strong>reated in 1980 to protest working conditions and political repression.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It began the non-violent nationalist opposition to communist rule that led to the fall of communism in eastern Europe in 1989</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polish trade Union first started off as a group of people who disliked the Soviet Union, and the control they were oppressing on the people of Poland.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Non-state trade union which had 9.4&nbsp; million members, but the Polish Communist Party allowed it.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 1980: The government announced increases in the price of meat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">August 1980: Workers at Gdansk Shipyard, led by Lech Walesa, put forward 21 demands to the government. They also started Solidarity, a non communist controlled trade union</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">30th August 1980: Representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying 21 of the workers' demands, including the right to strike . This is known as the Gdansk movement</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 1980: Solidarity members grew to 3.5 million</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 1980: Solidarity members grew to 7million, officially recognised by the government</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">January 1981: Members reached 9.4 million. Equates to ⅓ of all workers as Solidarity slowly transitioned to a revolutionary movement . The new solidarity program stated : &ldquo;History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom" .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 13 1981 : Prime Minister Jaruzelski declared martial law in Poland, and arrested Solidarity members - over 5,000 Solidarity supporters were arrested that night</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 8, 1982, Solidarity was banned</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On November 14, 1982, Wałęsa was released.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 22, 1983, martial law was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 5 1983 Walesa was awarded the nobel peace prize</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 26 1988, the Minister of Internal Affairs, declared on television that the government was willing to negotiate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 17, 1989, Solidarity was legalized</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the election, Solidarity received all 161 contested seats in the Sejm, and 99 out of 100 in the Senate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 24 1989, the Sejm elected Mazowiecki, a Solidarity representative, to be Prime Minister of Poland</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did the Polish Government agree to Solidarity&rsquo;s demands?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Union had a lot of supporters (75% of Poland's workforce or 33% of total Poland population), and there were many skilled workers amongst it. So a General strike would have devastated the Polish economy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even 30% of people in the Communist Party thought Solidarity was better.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lech Walesa was very careful with his negotiations and steered&nbsp; a mainly peaceful protest so that the Soviet Union wouldn&rsquo;t use force on them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why did the Polish Govt clamp down Solidarity in 1981?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Solidarity was becoming more and more of a political party against communism, and the Polish government needed to strengthen its powers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It also became really chaotic since groups of people all had different opinions, leading to rebellious actions over all of Poland. (1981 4-hour warning strike where 12 million Polish people took part and paralyzed the economy, and on December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government used their powers to suppress dissent)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brezhnev and other Soviet leaders also thought that if solidarity was allowed, it would be a bad influence to other Eastern European countries.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did the Polish govt retract the ban of Solidarity :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidary had a wide range of support from the International community : Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Christians, Socialists, etc, and condemned Jaruzelski&rsquo;s actions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations were formed like the Polish Solidarity Campaign in Britain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CIA, catholic church and western trade unions provided funds, equipment and advice to the Solidarity underground</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large protesting masses lead by people like Priest Jerzy Popieluszko showed support for Solidarity</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, Solidarity showed the extent of the population dislike of communism, and the lack of&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">influence of E.E governments&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It encouraged a wave of rebelliousness in other countries and the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. 99:1 election 1989.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Invasion of Afghanistan: December 24th 1979 - Feb 15th 1989</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a conflict between the Soviet Army and the Afghanistan Communist Govt against rebel groups called Mujahideen(who were backed by the USA)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The radical reforms and oppressions by the communist govt were deemed very unpopular and led to rural population revolts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Soviets were condemned for their cruel actions, harshly killing rebels and civilians, and eventually withdrew from Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soviets spent 15 billion rubles</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">14,000 Soviets killed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2million Afgan killed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US backed Mujahideen 90,000 killed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effects on the USSR:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USSR sent 50,000 troops to help the spread of communism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, nothing was gained and communism didn&rsquo;t spread further. This war only bankrupted the Soviet Union even more which slowly led to the end of the Cold war, as the USSR had no money left to fight against the Americans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Main reasons why Communism Collapsed in Eastern Europe:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence of anti-communist groups such as solidarity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E.E countries felt that they were upset with Communist control</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Stalin had fed them propaganda on how good Communism was.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of communism:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Spending too much money on arms race with the U.S</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.2 trillion spent on arms race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Failure of central command economy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Living standard well below West</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gorbachev&rsquo;s policies:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Glasnost and Perestroika encouraged too many reforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Changes in the system which lasted for decades</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- USSR&rsquo;s Vietnam, unwinnable and costly, which made the USSR closer to bankrupt</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ronald Reagan and the Arms race:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In 1981 Ronald Reagan increases US military spending by $32.6 billion USD</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-In 1982, gives go ahead for SDI&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This made the USSR unable to keep up with their bad economy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasons why Gorbachev caused the fall of the Soviet Union:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glasnost begun in the late &rsquo;80s, was a push for transparency in governance. It allowed citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their system and potential solutions.Gorbachev's decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, this turned out to be too much freedom. Gorbachev tried to stop these reforms but it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gorbachev also banned alcoholism.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1964, the life expectancy of Soviet men was 67. This declined to the age of 62 in 1980. However, although the average age expectancy did go up after this policy, the Soviet Economy fell even more since the balance of supply and demand changed so radically and suddenly that production levels couldn't keep up. To make matters worse, the shortage of goods had a negative effect on people's incentive to work. Before 1985, alcohol sales accounted for between 30 and 40 percent of state revenue, and by 1987 that revenue had shrunk by more than 37 billion rubles in just three years. The campaign was actually a key contributor to the economic crisis of 1987. And a lot of people didn&rsquo;t stop drinking. They were either making it by themselves at home or buying them at the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perestroika, undertaken at the same time, was an economic-reform process aimed at reviving a long-suffering economy. It moved the USSR away from a central-command model, in which business was owned and administered by the government, toward a hybrid communism-capitalism model incorporating free-market reform. Citizens were allowed to begin opening private businesses, and foreigners were allowed into the country to take part in joint ventures. However the economic reforms under perestroika loosened centralized control over many businesses which were meant to jump start the sluggish Soviet economy. They didn&rsquo;t.Instead, government spending soared (leading to a massive deficit), as did inflation and food prices</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Warsaw Pact officially disbanded in March and July of 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union as publicly announced by Mikhail Gorbachev&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction and the limitation of strategic offensive arms. The treaty was signed on 31 July 1991 and entered into force on 5 December 1994.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>KQ 12: Did NZ gain independence from one empire only to join another?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KQ 12: Introduction: NZ after Britain lost the Battle of Singapore in Feb 1942, realised that it was incapable of protecting them, so they needed to find new allies in order to stop the spread of communism. NZ also was keen to have her say in how the world should be organised and she saw the need for collective security&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations Charter (1945) :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ and its Prime Minister Peter Fraser was one of the founders of the United Nations . The UN was set up at the San Francisco Conference from April - May 1945 . New Zealand was one of the 51 nations, pledged to maintain peace and collective security, and achieve co-operation in finding solutions to world problems . Since 1945, NZ has supported the UN in : UNESCO and UNICEF (branches of UN agencies), Trusteeship Council, The Korean War, and Serving on the security council from 1954-5, 1966, and 2015-16 .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Fraser tried to make sure small countries had a say by opposing the rights of 5 permanent members to veto decisions, and persuading the UN to commit itself to defend all acts of aggression on all countries regardless of their size or dominance over the world . He saw NZ as the voice for small nations in the UN</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANZUS - 1 september 1951</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ANZUS treaty was a mutual defence pact signed between NZ, Australia, and the United States . The treaty signed gave the US a cause and justification to counter the spread of Communism in the Asian and Pacific region, and gave NZ and Australia security by an influential nation. The parties agreed to maintain and develop the military resources needed to resist an attack, and to consult the others if their security was threatened in the Pacific .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S had shown power and dominance throughout WW2 and the Cold war, e.g (Korean War). On the other hand, Britain was seeming more and more incapable of protecting the pacific colonies from communism and its British empire as by 1950 its empire had almost completely collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANZAM (1949): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ANZAM Treaty was a Commonwealth nations treaty signed between NZ, Australia, and British- Ruled Malaya . This treaty was an informal agreement to set up a rapid reaction force as a &lsquo;Defensive barrier against communism&rsquo; .This means that the 3 powers would fight any threats around the Southern ocean area .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSR (Commonwealth Strategic Reserve) (1955) :</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CSR was a joint military force of British, Australian and New Zealand armed forces . Based in Malaya, the CSR&rsquo;s primary roles were to deter communist aggression in South-East Asia, and to respond quickly to threats with an infantry brigade and a carrier group . New Zealand two frigates and several infantry unit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canberra Pact: (21 January 1944)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Canberra Pact, also known as the ANZAC pact, was a treaty of mutual defence between the governments of Australia and New Zealand, signed on 21 January 1944. The aim of the pact was to focus on working together on issues of mutual interests, and to support the aims of each other in the post-war world .</span><strong> It was the first treaty New Zealand signed as an independent country .&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seato: (September 8, 1954)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) is a regional-defense organization from 1955 to 1977 signed at Manila on September 8, 1954, by representatives of the US, Britain, and her commonwealth states . It was a treaty established between non-communist states to ensure collective safety and block the &lsquo;Domino Theory&rsquo; and&nbsp; further communist advances in the region .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ&rsquo;s involvement in Korea: NZ became involved in the Korean War, due to its support of the UN (collective security) and its alignment with the US ( Anzus) . NZ sent a 1500 men strong K Force army unit and 2 frigates (3794 men in total ) within a British Commonwealth force under the command of US general McArthur . Also, over half of NZ&rsquo;s naval force was involved. NZ showed America that it was committed to stop communism, and achieved so in the Korean War . NZ suffered 34 casualties in the war .&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ&rsquo;s involvement in East Timor September 1999 : The United Nations Assistance Mission (UNAMET)&nbsp; in East Timor, was established to conduct a referendum on whether or not the people of east timor wanted autonomy from Indonesia. In September 1999, NZ Defence Force (NZDF) sent 1100 men to East Timor to restore peace and security as part of a multi-national force, sanctioned by the UN (known as INTERFET). NZ personnel continued to serve in East Timor as part of a UN peacekeeping force until 2012. ost their lives on operational service - three as a result of enemy action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nz&rsquo;s involvement in Malaya : In 1957, the newly formed Malayan government asked for help in stopping the activities of communist agents during the &lsquo;Malayan Emergency&rsquo; . Approximately 4000 New Zealand servicemen served in Malaya between 1948 and 1966, of whom 20 l</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indonesian Confrontation (1963-1966) : The confrontation came about because Indonesia&rsquo;s leader Sukarno rejected the re-establishment of British power in the Malaya region, and sent in soldiers to fight the British. New Zealand sent around 1300 soldiers, and 66 were killed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam War: 1 Nov 1955 &ndash; 30 Apr 1975</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indo-China which consisted of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos was a French colony</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French industries paid low wages and treated vietnamese workers poorly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese occupied Vietnam during WW2</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ho Chi Minh formed a resistance organisation, the &lsquo;League for the Independence of Vietnam&rdquo; - Or Viet Minh</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viet Minh, under Ho Chi Minh resisted Japanese occupation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The french appeared back after WW2</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Viet Minh began a guerilla campaign to drive out the French</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1954, the Battle of Dien Bien Phu signified a huge French defeat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was this &ldquo;communist&rdquo; victory that prompted the United States to form the South-East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geneva Agreement 1954 : The US pressure to have Vietnam split at the 17th parallel was accepted . The Communist North was under Ho Chi Minh and the South under Ngo Dinh Diem with US support . New Zealand under Clifton Webb said : &ldquo;The security of South-East Asia is very important to us, and I think our own people are beginning to understand this better&rdquo; . New Zealand followed the British and US line and accepted the &lsquo;temporary division&rsquo; of Vietnam .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Vietnamese supported Communist guerillas in the South, who became known as the Viet Cong (VC) . The VC wanted to unify Vietnam under Communism - this led to usa having rebellions in their own vietnam i.e south vietnam</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ&rsquo;s involvement in Vietnam :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ did not pay much attention to the developments in Vietnam during WW2 but was generally supportive of the Viet Minh&rsquo;s aims as it was occupied by the Japanese</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once France returned to Vietnam, however, NZ switched sides with its allies.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>NZ sent surplus &lsquo;Lend Lease&rsquo; weapons to the French including 4 Naval Frigates in 1952</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>These consisted of 13,000 rifles and 600 machine guns, as well as ammunition</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Zealand Military officials visited Vietnam and a larger shipment was sent in 1953&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Britain did not want to be involved as it was already almost bankrupt because of WW2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain also feared that the conflict would widen into a third world war</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Britain declined,&nbsp; NZ declined to send troops for the US&rsquo;s proposal of a &lsquo;United Action&rsquo; involving a group of multinational troops</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Viet Minh won against the French, they were still not in a strong position</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because now the conflict was viewed as a part of the cold war, the UN decided to act and divided Vietnam into 2: Communist North (Viet Minh) and Capitalist South&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popular Ho Chi Minh led North and the unknown, anti-communist Ngo Dinh Diem led the South</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viet Minh refers to whole of North Vietnam while Viet Cong is a communist insurgency in the Capitalist South Vietnam</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ngo Dinh Diem 1963 was the final PM of south Vietnam and was supported by the US in the vietnam war before he was assassinated in 1963&nbsp; by USA themselves</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US involvement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 1961, John F Kennedy began sending &ldquo;combat advisors&rdquo;, usually green berets to train in the South Vietnamese Army&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US increased over $1 billion dollars in aid in 1961 for Ngo Dinh Diem&rsquo;s struggling government</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assassination of Diem in a military coup in 1963 and the installing of a new South Vietnamese President did not improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So US president Lyndon B Johnson made the decision to increase its commitment. So in March 1965, America put Operation Rolling Thunder into action</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is seen as a low cost option for defeating communism in North Vietnam . This was when bombing would last for 3 years, with millions of tons of bombs being dropped.&nbsp; With 80% of the population being rural, the bombing was not as destructive as America thought it would be. Still it threatened the lives of many Vietnamese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fearing that Viet Cong would attack US air bases, 3000 US troops were landed at Da Nang to protect them. These were the first of around 540,000 troops before the last were withdrawn in early 1973.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ involvement:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; National government under Keith Holyoake from 1960-1972 supported NZ to enter the war, but the Labour party opposition under Walter Nash, Arnold Nordmeyer, and Walter Nash opposed it .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ under the request of the U.S sent a medical team in 1963 and an engineering team in 1964. However it declined America&rsquo;s request for combat troops until 1967, when NZ reluctantly sent combat troops. The medical team, around 5-15 personnel per period, although it was in bad conditions, still managed 30-40 major operations and 80-100 minor operations a month, half of them being because of war.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, NZ sent 22 engineers to South Vietnam to build roads and bridges . However they were quickly withdrawn a year later</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 1965, Australia announced it would send a battalion of infantry to support the United States, putting further pressure on NZ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ also sent a combat army in 1965:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An artillery battalion was sent to Bien Hoa in 1965.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first placement of 120 men served, eventually totalling to around 550 men</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NZ artillery battery fired off 232,000 shells during its six-year employment&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then NZ sent 2 rifle companies to Vietnam in 1967.&nbsp; These soldiers were all volunteers, and in all 3900 men served.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Later in September 1968, a 26 strong special air services team was deployed in Vietnam. It carried over 155 missions, including long-range reconnaissance and the ambushing of enemy supply routes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall in the war, 37 NZ troops were killed, and 187 wounded&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem: By late 1963, the U.S feared that the South would be lost. Diem had managed to alienate large sections of South Vietnamese society. In growing chaos, the Viet Cong were carrying out ever bolder attacks against the South Vietnamese army, and their army generals planned to assassinate Ngo Dinh Diem.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Wanted NZ and AUS involvement in Vietnam so that it could more easily justify its presence if NZ and AUS said they too were afraid of the communism &ldquo;spreading&rdquo;</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Humiliation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy of containment had failed, US troops withdrew in 1973 and Vietnam was unified in 1975</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can't fight against 3rd world country</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakened US military morale</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affected US GDP - The </span><strong>Vietnam War</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cost $168 billion or $1 trillion in today's dollars. That included $111 billion in military operations and $28.5 billion in aid to South </span><strong>Vietnam</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">58,000 US soldiers, and 300,000 South Vietnamese soldiers died</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">800,000 Viet Minh and Viet Cong soldiers died</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outcomes of the Vietnam war for NZ</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vietnam war divided NZ as no other international issue had before</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour was taking moral stands on issues even though it was offending traditional allies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National acknowledged that a small country like NZ needed to depend on big countries for security and trade so did not want to offend the traditional allies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National&rsquo;s view was considered a pragmatic (practical) approach recognising NZ Vulnerability while Labour&rsquo;s approach albeit moral lacked a sense of practicality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holyoake&rsquo;s national government had little enthusiasm for the Vietnam war, not fully convinced by Domino theory and its effects on NZ, but found itself publicly supporting it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the new Labour government under Norman Kirk took a much more internationalist approach, as shown in this quote in 1973 :&rdquo;From now on, when we have to deal with a new situation, we will not say, what do the British think about it or what would the Americans want us to do ?&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyndon Johnson visited New Zealand in 1966 to encourage greater participation, and was greeted by cheering crowds&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This encouraged conservative members that the public was willing to stay in the war, and National&rsquo;s victory that year confirmed it</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could argue that New Zealand saw North Vietnam as the aggressor , and had duties to ANZUS and SEATO to help the United States&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour started by encourage non-military solutions to be found using the UN and Commonwealth</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the war progressed, and brutal images of war were shown on televisions for the first time, the myth and glory of war were erased</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scenes like the My Lai Massacre, and the Pulitzer-winning Napalm girl grew opposition to the war in Vietnam</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norman Kirk called for the withdrawal of New Zealand, and this view was supported by church groups, students, and the public</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By late 1960s, protest marches start taking place</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Labour became govt in 1972, PM Kirk withdrew the remaining combat units&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soldiers who returned came back to a hostile reception</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ veterans were accused of being &lsquo;war-mongers&rsquo; and &lsquo;baby killers&rsquo;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government did not formally welcome the soldiers home</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam veterans struggled to get compensation for war conditions, such as cancer from Agent Orange</span></li>

<p><strong>KQ13: WHY DID NZ REJECT THE NUCLEAR UMBRELLA?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">History of Nuclear testing:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear testing in the Pacific region began in the 1950s. Both Britain and the US conducted tests. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The US by 1962, when it stopped testing in the Pacific, had exploded 106 bombs on Bikini Atoll and Enewetak, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From 1952 to 1962 Britain exploded a total of 21 bombs - in the Australian outback, and on Montebello and Christmas Islands. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; France began testing in the Pacific in 1966, and by 1996 had tested 193 nuclear bombs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time France stopped testing in the Pacific in early 1996, over 250 nuclear detonations had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand&rsquo;s choices of direction (after WW2) seem to have been:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assert independent efforts to safeguard the Pacific area where NZ could be a strong influence.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maintain the commonwealth connection and stay part of Britain&rsquo;s global strategy.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Promote international peacekeeping by supporting a strong United Nations which could remove the causes of war.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose sides in the growing Cold War conflict between the USSR and the USA.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Try to wipe out causes of war with aid and development programmes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Join military defence pacts to gain military support just in case war did become a threat.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Find another major protector &ndash; swap Britain for the USA.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During WW2, NZ was eager to help develop the atomic bomb. However, by 1975, the government could no longer put off a decisive decision on whether or not to build a nuclear reactor on Kaipara Harbour. By this time, concerns about health risks of the nuclear industry had made it less desirable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France carried out its first testing in Mururoa Atoll in 1966, it provided a focus for NZ&rsquo;s anti nuclear campaign.In 1971, a poll showed that 82% of NZers were opposed to French testing in the Pacific. So when Labour came to power in 1972, Norman Kirk challenged French nuclear testing in the pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1973, in combination with the Australian Labour Government, NZ took France to the World Court for its nuclear testing. The court found against France and ordered it to stop its testing programme. However, France ignored this order. NZ discovered that its allies, America and Britain were unwilling to take any action to help NZ and Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since America and Britain didn&rsquo;t help us, the nuclear movement begane to take on a nationalistic flavour. A petition against French nuclear testing got over 81,000 signatures while peace organisations such as Peacemedia and Greenpeace formed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses to Nuclear testing&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :&bull;1976 &lsquo;Peace Squadron&rsquo; formed to protest against US ship visits to NZ waters&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull;1981 Devonport declared itself nuclear-free &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull;1982 Christchurch declared itself nuclear-free&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull;Popular responses to US ship visits: 1983 35,000 people protested against the visit of USS Truxtun&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainbow Warrior is bombed: On 10th July 1985, French agents blew up and sank the greenpeace vessel, Rainbow Warrior while it was anchored at the port of Auckland. The vessel had been preparing for another voyage to protest against French nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll. Fernando Pereira, a portuguese photographer on board at the time was killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequences of the Rainbow Warrior Bombing:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">France, being an ally of NZ, initially denied involvement and stated that &ldquo;the French government does not deal with its opponents in such ways. However, after serious investigation 2 spies were caught in NZ, 3 in Australia but were released, and 1 was not caught. The 2 people captured in NZ were sentenced to 10 years in Prison. However, France threatened an economic embargo of NZ&rsquo;s exports to Europe. Such an action would have crippled NZ&rsquo;s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1986, in a deal under the supervision of the UN, PM. David Lange and France signed an agreement for France to pay $13 million dollars and apologise, while also detaining the 2 spies at a French military base for 3 years. However, the 2 spies were released before the 3 year time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Rainbow Warrior sunk, In 1992, France declared a short-term halt on nuclear testing. NZ hoped that this in fact marked the end of its programme; however, in 1995 resting resumed.National PM. Jim Bolger immediately condemned the new blasts. However, France continued to ignore NZ although detonating the last series of bombs in early 1996. In March of 1996 France,Britain and the U.S finally all signed the CTBT.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events that led to NZ being kicked out of ANZUS:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 1960 to 1984 there were nearly 150 visits by US ships alone. Of these, only 13 were nuclear powered. In terms of weaponry, the Americans always had a policy to &ldquo;neither confirm nor deny&rdquo; the presence of nuclear armaments on the vessels. T</span><strong>his was to avoid giving too much information to the Russians. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this caused public concern over the risk of a nuclear accident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1976, a &lsquo;Peace Squadron&rsquo; was formed by members of a college to block the arrival of nuclear-powered vessels into the harbour. Public Opinion polls showed that 39% of people opposed US ships from entering NZ. However around 60% of people still agreed to allow nuclear ships to come in since NZer&rsquo;s wanted to maintain a strong relationship with the US.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, protests started to arise in the following years. In 1981, Devonport, one of NZ&rsquo;s major naval bases, declared itself nuclear free. Within 2 years, 37 local authorities had followed the suit. In 1982, Christchurch became the first city to declare itself nuclear free. A year later, more than 35,000 people turned out to protest against the arrival of the USS Truxtun in Auckland. Some 400 different groups, covering a broad range of NZ society. Were now represented in the anti-nuclear movement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1984, polls showed that 70% of NZer&rsquo;s did not want ships capable of carrying nuclear weapons to come to NZ. That year, National lost the snap election, and Labour came into power under David Lange. David Lange was very anti-nuclear and labour was known to be anti-pragmatic so it was not surprising that he was very anti-nuclear and he never cared about the sanctions or effects on NZ for going against global powers and even debated in Britain about why Nuclear missiles are bad. and so he found himself caught between a public distaste of nuclear-armed ships and the continuation of the ANZUS alliance with America.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So David Lange tried to please all NZ citizens by requesting the U.S to send vessels which are not carrying nuclear armaments. So in 1984, the U.S announced that the Buchannan would come to NZ. However, the US would still &lsquo;neither confirm nor deny&rsquo; whether there was nuclear weaponry onboard. So in early 1985, Lange declined the Buchanon from entering NZ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S didn&rsquo;t like that a small country was trying to command the U.S on what to do. So the U.S deemed ANZUS to be un-operative and took actions against NZ. The U.S cut off all military and intelligence links with NZ were immediately cut. There were also threats of other actions, including cutting NZ&rsquo;s trade access to US markets, but these did not eventuate. This time, not even Australia would support NZ.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ Refused the docking of USS Truxtun 1982</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* because it refused to say if it carried nuclear weapons or not but in reality ( a few years later) it was known that truxton carried no nuclear weapons but still refused to specify if it did or not.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 10,000 protestors protesting against the ship being docked so PM of NZ had no choice but to say no to the US ship</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US was furious because it was never mentioned in the Anzus treaty that the US had to state whether a ship had nuclear missiles or not.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans to kick out nz FROM US markets arise but they don't happen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However exports to US definitely take a 4% hit and also France exports ( see above why France and NZ had issues)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon&rsquo;s policy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour was defeated in the 1975 election and National under Muldoon came to power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His outlook had been shaped by him having been a World War II veteran. Other cabinet members also shared his view that New Zealand's security lay in traditional ties to Britain and strengthening links with the United States. Muldoon argued these links also help economic security. Labour's policies were therefore unrealistic and even dangerous because they had upset the United States. These sentiments dominated the National Party government between 1975 and 1984.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon said: &ldquo;Our foreign policy is trade. We are not interested in the normal foreign policy matters to any extent; we are interested in trade.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon encouraged visits by nuclear powered and or armed warships from Britain and the United States to &lsquo;maintain&rsquo; defence ties threatened by Kirk. He also softened protests against French nuclear tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon thought of&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communism</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was similar to the aggressive anti-Communist viewpoint of Ronald Reagan (President of the United States in 1981 - 1989).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon claimed in 1976 that because Russian warships had passed through the Tasman Sea, this showed the threat</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to New Zealand and that small Pacific island nations might be overawed by Soviet naval power or seduced by offers of economic assistannce. revivig good relationships with our allies would provide the protection we needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LABOUR: HIGHLY MORAL STYLE GOV THAT IS NOT PRAGMATIC (doesn&rsquo;t care about allies or trade and puts it own values over the immediate conflict)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NATIONAL: HIGHLY PRACTICAL GOVERNMENT THAT CARES ABOUT ECONOMY AND ALLIES</span></p>

<p><strong>NZ INVOLVEMENTS (REWRITTEN FOR REVISION)</strong></p>
<p><strong>NZ&rsquo;s involvement in Korea</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: NZ became involved in the Korean War, due to its support of the UN (collective security) and its alignment with the US ( Anzus) . NZ sent a 1500 men strong K Force army unit and 2 frigates (3794 men in total ) within a British Commonwealth force under the command of US general McArthur . Also, over half of NZ&rsquo;s naval force was involved. NZ showed America that it was committed to stop communism, and achieved so in the Korean War . NZ suffered 34 casualties in the war .&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>NZ&rsquo;s involvement in East Timor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : The United Nations Assistance Mission (UNAMET)&nbsp; in East Timor, was established to conduct a referendum on whether or not the people of east timor wanted autonomy from Indonesia. Immediately as the result was announced, East Timor descended into anarchy .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In september 1999, NZ Defence Force (NZDF) personnel went into East Timor to restore peace and security as part of a multi-national force, sanctioned by the UN (known as INTERFET) . NZ personnel continued to serve in East Timor as part of a UN peacekeeping force until 2012.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nz&rsquo;s involvement in Malaya</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : In 1957, the newly formed Malayan government asked for help in stopping the activities of communist agents during the &lsquo;Malayan Emergency&rsquo; Approximately 4000 New Zealand servicemen served in Malaya between 1948 and 1966, of whom 20 lost their lives on operational service - three as a result of enemy action.</span></p>
<p><strong>Indonesian Confrontation </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1963-1966) : The confrontation came about because Indonesia&rsquo;s leader Sukarno rejected the re-establishment of British power in the Malaya region, and sent in soldiers to fight the British. New Zealand sent around 1300 soldiers, and 66 were killed.</span></p>
<p><strong>KQ14: Why was NZ&rsquo;s economic prosperity damaged after WW2?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NZ ECONOMIC POSITION UP TO WW2:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&bull;Many New Zealanders had come from Britain = close ties between the two countries. Most exports/imports were to and from the UK.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first shipment to Britain of frozen meat was in 1882 with refrigerated ships.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers experimented with better sheep breeds.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dairy industry also began to take off. Pastoral-farming products became an even larger share of exports &ndash; over 90% in the mid-20th century.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a Liberal government New Zealand went into a boom which lasted until about 1920. Pakeha NZers had one of highest living standards in the world (much of this from acquired land ownership).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the First World War New Zealand suffered a short depression due to import prices, signalling the end of the Liberal boom.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1920s were a period of slow growth with lots of overseas borrowing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1920&rsquo;s electricity consumption increased by 22% and helped efficiency in farming methods, especially mechanisation. Production increased.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1930&rsquo;s NZ was hit by the Great Depression. Economic activity declined &ndash; gross domestic product (GDP) is thought to have been only 75% of capacity in the 1932/33 year.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ also had high overseas debt (in 1933 40% of government income went on paying the interest alone) so they cut back on expenditure.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exports fell by 40% and wool prices fell so much that sales barely covered the cost of transportation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">People&rsquo;s incomes and living standards were also thought to have dropped up to 20%.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">NZ worked to rectify the effects of the Depression and reduced imports, increased its own manufacturing, invested in public works and addressed unemployment (possibly up to 17% of the population became unemployed by 1932).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relief payments were introduced to help but there were strict conditions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Depression there was much criticism of economic policy, which restricted government spending, devalued the currency, cut nominal wages and reduced interest rates and the value of mortgages.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, NZ recovered relatively quickly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">During WWII &lsquo;aerial topdressing&rsquo; helped boost farm production again (and thus further mechanisation). Rural towns benefited from the wealth of farmers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government tried to control imports, and more products were made locally. Most local manufacturing was small. Large factories included:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- farm processing: dairy factories made products like butter and cheese, and freezing works prepared meat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- resource processing: factories for steel and aluminium production, oil and gas conversion, and timber processing, including pulp and paper.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Maori and economic change up until WWII</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Maori often did not share this same economic position throughout this period (1900-1939)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Māori had found it difficult to get into sheep farming, they also faced obstacles entering capital-intensive dairy farming, because of their lack of access to commercial capital, together with the alienation of much Māori land.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Great Depression it is thought that Maori unemployment rates were even higher than 40% opposed to 12% Pakeha.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NZ&rsquo;S NEED TO FIND ANOTHER ALLY:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to the 1960s, pastoral products such as meat, butter, cheese and wool were over 90% of NZ&rsquo;s exports and NZ was reliant on the British market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1930s Britain took more than 80% of New Zealand exports. By 1960 it took 53%, which reduced to 36% in 1970, and 5% in 2007.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">During and after the war, Britain subsidised its own farmers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1961 Britain announced that it was seeking to join the European Economic Community (EEC). The founding EEC nations had agreed on a &lsquo;common agricultural policy,&rsquo; which effectively excluded outside producers from the European market.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a logical move for Britain, but in New Zealand it was greeted with dismay. The British government agreed that it would not enter the EEC unless New Zealand&rsquo;s &lsquo;vital interests&rsquo; were protected.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand intensified the search for alternative markets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collapse of the wool price in 1966 and the general weakening of dairy and meat prices accelerated diversification of markets, adding strong price incentives to the public policy objectives.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the 1970&rsquo;s Arab oil crises added to the slump as prices rose.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain joins the EEC 1973</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain had secured a special arrangement (the Luxembourg agreement) for NZ&rsquo;s butter, cheese and lamb. The deal was for a limited period but it gave New Zealand time to diversify.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1970 Britain took more than 90% of New Zealand&rsquo;s butter exports and 75% of cheese exports. The Luxembourg agreement reduced the butter quota by roughly 17% and the cheese quota by roughly 68% over 5 years.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand had to change and developed a highly diversified industrial structure. The &lsquo;insulated&rsquo; economy that had begun to emerge in the 1940&rsquo;s was put into greater effect by the 1970&rsquo;s (a protected economy with greater barriers- this especially added greater control on imports)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overseas borrowing continued.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Added cost increases were passed on to the consumer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Import barriers induced(means stopped in this context) many British, American, and Australian multinationals to establish industrial plants in New Zealand.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New trade partners were looked for such as Australia- a partial New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1965 (later Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement of 1983)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">All bilateral agreements between New Zealand and Britain had to be terminated and preferential treatment of British imports into New Zealand ended in 1977.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why was NZ impacted so much by the stock market crash of 1987?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bull market is the condition of a financial market in which prices are rising or are expected to rise and a bear market is the opposite.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying and selling of shares increased in NZ in 1980s, so that:</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">By July 1987 more than 40% of the country&rsquo;s adult population owned shares.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading levels were four times the level they had been 12 months earlier.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep up with the amount of business, share broking houses had to employ more staff, many of them inexperienced and prone to making mistakes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some investors bought shares and sold them again before paying for their purchase, which made it difficult to monitor prices and ownership.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Margin trading&rsquo; (buying shares on credit) became common.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;No frills&rsquo; share brokers emerged.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The stock market crash &ndash; 19 October 1987</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share prices reached an all-time high on 18 September 1987 with a record 309 listed companies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 1982 the NZ market rose about 600% (compared with 250% in the US and 400% in Australia).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spooked by a dramatic fall on Wall Street, the NZ stock market collapsed on 20 October, and became known as &lsquo;Black Tuesday.&rsquo;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share values dropped by $5.7 billion &ndash; 4.3% &ndash; in four hours, as thousands of investors fled the market.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Zealand&rsquo;s recovery was slow and by 1993 only 140 companies remained listed.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most broking firms drastically downsized. Many companies merged or were taken over &ndash; some by overseas firms.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 1996 over half of New Zealand broking firms had overseas connections.</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why did Many Nzers invest in shares?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>The only thing left to invest in, that was unregulated and free, was the share market.</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>NATIONAL POLICIES MADE THEM INVEST</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share brokers were ringing up people and saying &ldquo;you're missing out&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Muldoon&rsquo;s policies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon came to power promising to lead "a Government of the ordinary bloke&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He appointed himself Minister of Finance. His tenure as Prime Minister was plagued by an economic pattern of stagnation, high inflation, growing unemployment, and high external debts and borrowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Economic policies of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_National_Government_of_New_Zealand"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included national </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">superannuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wage and price freezes, industrial incentives, and the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Big"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think Big</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industrial projects</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In foreign policy, Muldoon adopted an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Soviet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-Soviet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stance and re-emphasised New Zealand's defence commitments to the United States and Australia under the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANZUS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;His refusal to stop a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_South_Africa_rugby_union_tour_of_New_Zealand_and_the_United_States"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> divided the country and led to unprecedented civil disorder in 1981.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muldoon led his party to two additional election victories in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_New_Zealand_general_election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1978</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_New_Zealand_general_election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1981</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He called a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_Zealand_general_election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">snap election in 1984</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which National suffered a significant defeat to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Labour_Party"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shortly before leaving office, amid a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_Zealand_constitutional_crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Muldoon was forced by the incoming Government to devalue the New Zealand dollar.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rogernomics</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>The economic policies of the Fourth Labour government, elected in 1984, came to be known as rogernomics.&nbsp;</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Named after Roger Douglas (minister of finance 1984-88)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Douglas believed in a free market with minimal interference in the economy by the government</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under Rogernomics, Fortress NZ would be deregulated</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>On winning the 1984 election, Labour found out that NZ&rsquo;s overseas debt had blown out dangerously ($1.7 billion had been borrowed in 2 weeks by muldoon gov)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Douglas saw this already debt-stricken and debilitating NZ economy as an advantage because he could bring in his policies, which otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be accepted</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>State owned enterprises and Privatisation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a span of a decade, NZ went from one of the most protected and regulated economies to one of the least</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large government owned enterprises such as AirNZ, telecom, post office, BNZ and railways were turned into SOEs (state owned enterprises)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were government owned businesses but run by business people on the aim of making profit</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>IN JUST OVER A DECADE, $15 billion worth of assets owned by NZ taxpayers had been sold (privatised)</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the &ldquo;restructuring of SOEs?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>In order to achieve efficiency, the SOEs began to dramatically cut staff in a process called restructuring</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coal crop cut 50% of staff</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elec corp cut 25% of staff</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telecom cut 30% of staff</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Railway cut 72% of staff</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>The cost of restructuring fell mostly on unskilled and semi-skilled people and most of them were Maori.</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>By 1989 - maori unemployment 20%</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total unemployment figure 100,000 for NZ(including maori and pakeha)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National&rsquo;s comeback : Ruthanasia 1990-93</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Labour thrown out of power in 1990 election (stock market crash of 87)</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rogernomics turned into ruthanasia</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ruth Richardson (min. Of finance - national) began by cutting down welfare benefits by a total of $1.6 billion</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ability of the workers to negotiate pay and conditions was further weakened by the passing of the Employment Contracts Acts of 1991</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment shot up further -180,000 (1990s)</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>By the middle of the 1990s, health, housing and education had undergone the most dramatic changes.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Pasifika immgration experience&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>During the 1960s many pasifika people were encouraged to migrate to NZ because of an industrial labour shortage in the country&nbsp;</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>However, by the 1970s as economic conditions worsened, calls came from different sectors of NZ society to stop immigration from NZ</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the minds of some people, immigration was linked to crime</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>This negative view of the Pakeha would trigger the Polynesian Panthers&rsquo; formation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dawn raids</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginning in the early 1970s, the Dawn Raids saw government forces launch early morning operations in the homes and workplaces of people who had overstayed their visas. New Zealand had welcomed thousands of migrants from Pacific Islands after the end of World War Two, needing workers for its booming economy.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Pasifika people were simply racially profiled and target more than other communities because they &ldquo;are different from nzers&rdquo;</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>THe dawn raids would commence the next biggest change in NZ history&nbsp;</strong></li>

<li><strong>The poverty of the pasifika people were made worse by the financial contributions expected by the church back home</strong></li>
</ul>
